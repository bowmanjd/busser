# busser

A tool that handles tables.

Primarily CSV files and Microsoft SQL Server tables.

## Usage

Busser combines multiple tools into a single command line interface. Executing

```sh
busser --help
```

is a good start, and each subcommand has its own help as well. For instance:

```sh
busser output --help
```

Busser is not quite ready for public consumption. The command line interface changes rapidly, and sometimes things break.
